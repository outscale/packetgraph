/**
 * Create a new queue brick
 *
 * Queues are made to temporary keep a burst of packets waiting to be polled.
 * Queue bricks are pollable like a nic brick but get it's burst of packets from
 * an other "friend" brick (an other queue).
 *
 * This allow several graph to connect each other in a thead-safe maner.
 * A queue brick only have one pole (like nic bricks).
 *
 * To get a working queue, you will need two friend queues, example:
 *
 * [A]----[Queue1] ~ [Queue2]----[B]
 *
 * - [A] is linked to [Queue1], same for [Queue2] and [B].
 * - [Queue1] and [Queue2] are friend.
 * - [A] can burst packets to [Queue1] which store burst and returns.
 * - later, [Queue2] is polled. It get burst from [Queue1] and burst to [B].
 *
 * This way, [A] and [Queue1] can run in a separate thread than [Queue2] and [B]
 * To make [Queue1] and [Queue2] friends, see pg_queue_friend().
 *
 * Queues have a maximal size, if you try to burst in a full queue, the oldest
 * burst will be free.
 *
 * @name:	name of the brick
 * @size:	maximal size of the queue. If the queue is full, old bursts
 *		will be dropped. If size <= 0, a default queue size of 10 will
 *		be chosen.
 * @error:	is set in case of an error
 * @return:	a pointer to a brick structure on success, NULL on error
