 * A graph is like a brick container: you can add bricks to it (push),
 * you can remove bricks (pop) or directly destroy bricks inside graph.
 * Graph are useful to manipulate bricks by their name and not having to store
 * all bricks by ourself.
 *
 * An important thing to know is that graph (and bricks) are not thread safe:
 * - You must not call pg_graph_poll on the same graph in parallel.
 * - You must not add the same brick in two different graph and use them in
 *   parallel.

 * @param   error is set in case of an error. 
 * @return  new allocated and initialized graph, NULL on fail.
