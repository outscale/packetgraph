# Packetgraph ?

Packetgraph is a library aiming to give the user a tool to build networks graph easily, It's built upon the fast [DPDK library](http://dpdk.org/).

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/outscale/packetgraph.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/outscale/packetgraph) [![packetgraph documentation](doc/packetgraph_doc.png)](https://outscale.github.io/packetgraph/doc/master)

The goal of this library is to provide a really EASY interface to
build you own DPDK based application using [Network Function
Virtualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_function_virtualization)
Everyone is free to use this library to build up there own network application.

Once you have created and connected all bricks in you network graph,
some bricks will be able to poll a burst of packets (max 64 packets)
and let the burst propagate in you graph.

Connections between bricks don't store any packets and each burst will
propagate in the graph without any copy.

Each graph run on one core but you can connect different graph using
Queue bricks (which are thread safe). For example, a graph can be
split on demand to be run on different core or even merged.

If you want a graphical representation of a graph, you can generate a [dot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_%28graph_description_language%29) output.

# Available bricks (ipv4/ipv6):

- switch: a layer 2 switch
- rxtx: setup your own callbacks to get and sent packets
- tap: classic kernel virtual interface
- vhost: allow to connect a vhost NIC to a virtual machine (virtio based)
- firewall: allow to filter traffic passing through it (based on [NPF](https://github.com/rmind/npf))
- diode: only let packets pass in one direction
- hub: act as a hub device, passing packets to all connected bricks
- nic: allow to pass packets to a NIC of the system (accelerated by DPDK)
- print: a basic print brick to show packets flowing through it
- antispoof: a basic mac checking, arp anti-spoofing and ipv6 neighbor discovery anti-spoofing
- vtep: VXLAN Virtual Terminal End Point switching packets on virtual LANs, can encapsulate packets over ipv4 or ipv6
- queue: temporally store packets between graph
- pmtud(ipv4 only): Path MTU Discovery is an implementation of [RFC 1191](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1191)
- fragment-ip: fragment and reassemble packets
- user-dipole: setup your own callback in a dipole brick, to filter or implement your own protocol

A lot of other bricks can be created, check our [wall](https://github.com/outscale/packetgraph/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Awall) ;)

# How should I use packetgraph ?

![packetgraph usage flow](https://osu.eu-west-2.outscale.com/jerome.jutteau/16d1bc0517de5c95aa076a0584b43af6/packetgraph_flow.png "packetgraph usage flow")

# Examples

To build and run examples, you may first check how to build packetgraph below and adjust your configure command before make:
```
$ ./configure --with-examples
$ make
```

To run a specific example, check run scripts in tests directories:
```
$ ./examples/switch/run_vhost.sh
$ ./examples/switch/run.sh
$ ./examples/firewall/run.sh
$ ./examples/rxtx/run.sh
$ ./examples/dperf/run.sh
...
```

# Building

You will need to build DPDK before building packetgraph.

## Install needed tools

You may adapt this depending of your linux distribution:
```
$ sudo apt-get install automake libtool libpcap-dev libglib2.0-dev libjemalloc-dev
```

## Build DPDK

```
$ git clone http://dpdk.org/git/dpdk
$ cd dpdk
$ git checkout -b v17.02 v17.02
$ make config T=x86_64-native-linuxapp-gcc
```

Note: use `T=x86_64-native-linuxapp-clang` to build with clang

Edit build/.config and be sure to set the following parameters to 'y':
- CONFIG_RTE_LIBRTE_PMD_PCAP

If you don't want to use some special PMD in DPDK requiring kernel headers,
you will have to set the following parameters to 'n':
- CONFIG_RTE_EAL_IGB_UIO
- CONFIG_RTE_KNI_KMOD

Once your .config file is read, you can now build dpdk as follow:

```
$ make EXTRA_CFLAGS='-fPIC'
```

Finally, set `RTE_SDK` environment variable:
```
$ export RTE_SDK=$(pwd)
```

## Build packetgraph
```
$ git clone https://github.com/outscale/packetgraph.git
$ cd packetgraph
$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install
```

Note: to build with clang, you can use `./configure_clang` wrapper instead of `./configure`.
