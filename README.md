/!\ WIP ALERT /!\

This reprository is under active developpement and is subject to heavy
modifications.

# Packetgraph

Packetgraph library is build upon [DPDK](http://dpdk.org/) making a collection
of network bricks you can connect to form a network graph.
The goal of this project is to provides a low-latency software defined
network.
Everyone is free to use this library to build up there own network
infrastructure.

Here are current developped bricks available in packetgraph:

- switch: a layer 2 switch
- vhost: allow to connect a vhost NIC to a virtual machine (virtio based)
- firewall: allow to filter traffic passing through it (based on NPF)
- diode: only let packets pass in one direction
- hub: act as a hub device, passing packets to all connected bricks
- nic: allow to pass packets to a NIC of the system (accelerated by DPDK)
- print: a basic print brick to show packets flowing through it
- antispoof: a basic mac and arp anti-spoofing brick

Comming soon:

- vtep: VXLAN Virtual Terminal End Point switching packets on virtual LANs

# Examples

Here are some possible graphics you can do with paquetgraph. You will find
some implementations in "examples" folder.

# Building

In order to reduce dependencies, the project has been splitted in several libs:
- A "core" library on which all bricks relies on.
- Each brick is a library.

Check each libraries to build them :)
